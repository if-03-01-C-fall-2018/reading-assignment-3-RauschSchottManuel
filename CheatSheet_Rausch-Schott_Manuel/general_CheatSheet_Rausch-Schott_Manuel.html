		<h2><b>General(history, etc.)</b></h2>
		<hr>
		<p>1.  The HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) and the HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) made the WWW(World Wide Web) successful as well as the URI(Unified Resources Locator)</p>
		<p>2.  Your Resources are addressed with the URL</p>
		<p>3.  The URL is divided into the scheme(Protocol)(http,https,pop3,smtp, ...), the web server(www.google.com, www.myspace.com, ...), and the file or the path(/index.html, /wiki/URL, ...). An example URL is : https://en.wikipedia.org/index.html</p>
		<p>4.  A web server is a server running on an PC you can access via the internet(via the URL) for example 'apache'</p>
		<p>5.  A web server stores a website by an URL, transfers it to clients and processes it</p>
		<p>6.  The content is stored in files on the web servers storage but thats not always like this. It depends on the implementation of the web server</p>
		<p>7.  Content is described with tags</p>
		<p>8.  A web client is program that runs on a PC and connects to the internet and the web server  for example Google Chrome</p>
		<p>9.  A web client requests a content form a website by sending the URL to an web server and displays it on the web browser</p>
		<p>10. A web client is not necessarily the same as a web browser but the other way round it is because the web client is an application or a web browser</p>
		
		<h2><b>(. . . editing . . . ) (HTML coding)</b></h2>
		
		<p>1. The &lthtml&gt tag tells the browser that this is an HTML page/document</p>
		<p>2. The &lt!Doctype&gt is not a tag and it tells the browser about the HTML version this page is written</p>
		<p>3. The two most important tags in HTML are the &lthead&gt tag and the &ltbody&gt tag they tell the browser how the page should look like</p>
		<p>4. To emphasize a text you use the &ltem&gt tag. In default it sets the font into italic</p>
		<p>5. To mark up your text use the &ltstrong&gt tag. In default the font gets set to bold</p>
